# Social Touch

Social Touch is a haptic research project for my thesis. It is about integrating haptics to MS Teams and measuring the effect of mediated touch on social presence in affective relationships.

The code is for activating a vibrotactile sleeve (has Adafruit ESP32 Feather) whenever an arm containing Force Sensitive Resistors and Arduino Leonardo. Both setups are in different rooms and connected over WiFi.
